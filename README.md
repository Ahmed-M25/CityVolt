## Project Overview

The CityVolt project leverages various data sources, including real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API and population statistics from the World Bank, to predict electricity usage in Cairo. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, CityVolt provides actionable insights that can help in reducing power outages and optimizing electricity distribution.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Predictions:** Utilizes machine learning models like Random Forest and Time Series Analysis to forecast electricity demand.
- **Real-Time Weather Integration:** Integrates weather data from the Open-Meteo API to account for environmental factors affecting electricity usage.
- **Population Data Analysis:** Incorporates population growth statistics from the World Bank to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard built with React and TypeScript to visualize electricity usage predictions across Cairo's governorates.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For data processing, machine learning, and backend development.
- **React & TypeScript:** For developing the interactive frontend dashboard.
- **Open-Meteo API:** For fetching real-time and historical weather data.
- **World Bank API:** For accessing population data.
